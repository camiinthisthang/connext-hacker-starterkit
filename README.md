# Hacker Starter Kit

## Getting Help

The [Connext discord](https://discord.gg/7VVWguNx5J) is the best place to get support if you run into issues while developing with Connext. 

## Developer Resources

[xapp-starter](https://github.com/connext/xapp-starter) provides an overview and reference code to get started building crosschain applications. [This workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5vKOVCozqY) walks developers through working with the xapp-starter repo.

[Bridging tokens and data guide](https://ethglobal.com/guides/bridging-tokens-and-data-adzmk#introduction) is a 101 level resource to understanding bridging as a concept, different types of bridges and their security, Connext's modular architecture, and the `xcall` method.  

The [developer section](https://docs.connext.network/developers/intro) of the Connext docs walks developers through understanding xcall, complete with examples and guides.

## Project Inspiration

|---|---|---|---|
|  Authsome | Authsome implements a multi-signature wallet using the predicate system of the Fuel VM and Sway programming language. This multi-signature wallet is then used as the basis for an pluggable auth infrastructure, similar to Web3Auth. | https://taikai.network/ethlisbon/hackathons/ethlisbon-2022/projects/cl9tv1epm14319401w1mf7ltuhm/idea | ETH Lisbon 2022 |

## Project Ideas

| Name | Description | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
|  Fuel Lotto | Create a simple counter that releases money to the user who increases the counter to a pre-defined number. Follow the [Developer Quickstart](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html) to get the counter functionality set up. | Easy |
|  Community run Twitter | Users can propose tweets, token holders vote on the proposed tweet. If the tweet gets x amount of votes or more, post the tweet automatically via the twitter API. | Intermediate |
|  DAO on Fuel | A smart contract for a DAO. | Intermediate |
|  Flash Loans | A lower-level detail that could enable flash-loans. Any contract could mint n tokens for the caller, as long as theyâ€™re returned to the contract at the end of the call (and maybe burned as well).| Advanced |
